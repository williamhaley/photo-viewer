# Photo Viewer

Rudimentary full screen photo/image viewer. Designed for a Raspberry Pi to use it as a digital picture frame.

Though, it should be noted that a simple Kodi Slideshow would probably [accomplish the same thing](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Raspberry-Pi-Media-Panel-fka-Digita/).

# Install

```
sudo apt-get install \
	python3 \
	python3-pip \
	libopenjp2-7
```

```
pip3 -r requirements.txt
```
